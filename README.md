When I select my pictures to create an album, I always delete the bad pictures, both JPG and RAW files since I will not use them anymore.

With this script, you just have to delete the JPG files that you want to delete and run the BAT file. It will detect which JPG files have been deleted, and it will delete the CR2 files. You don't have to manually delete every CR2 file.

Of course it can work with any other type of file, just edit the extension.

It seems quite simple but I put this script for the people that don't know anything about Batch, like me ;). It is a tricky language.
